# agamotto - Wheel Options Strategy Management
**agamotto** is a simple Flask app to stay help you stay on top of your Wheel options trading strategy. Like the MCU's [Eye of Agamotto](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Agamotto), it allows you, the bold trader, to harness the power of ~~theta~~ time.

> **Note:** I've developed the basic prototype for **agamotto**. The code will be released in due time.

## Prerequisites

- Conda
- A TD Ameritrade API key
- Linux OS preferred; **agamotto** was not tested on Windows - use at your own risk
- If you want to operate the app on Docker:
    - Docker
    - Docker Compose

## Installation
Clone this repo to a local directory:

```bash
cd <your-directory>
git clone https://github.com/chrischow/agamotto.git
```

Then, create a `.env` file in the `agamotto` directory with the following variables:

```bash
API_KEY=<TD Ameritrade API key>
EMAIL=<Email cum username to initialise admin account>
PASSWORD=<Password to initialise admin account>
```

### Without Docker
Create a Conda environment and install the required packages:

```bash
conda create -n agamotto
conda activate agamotto

cd agamotto
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, initialise the admin account:

```bash
python create_admin.py
```


### With Docker
I have yet to upload the image to Docker Hub. Until then, you'll need to build the Docker image locally:

```bash
cd agamotto
docker build --tag agamotto .
```

## Usage

### Without Docker
Run the following commands to launch **agamotto** in a new terminal:

```bash
cd agamotto
flask run
```

Note that this launches a development server, not a production server, but it should suffice for individual use.

### With Docker
Launch the app using Docker Compose. It can be accessed at `localhost:5050`.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Features
See the [documentation](https://chrischow.github.io/agamotto) for a walkthrough of the app.

## Future Work
- [ ] Push container to Docker Hub
- [ ] Use of PostgreSQL database instead of SQLite
- Dashboard:
    - [ ] Break strategies down by put only, put rolled, full wheel, half wheel (sell stock after being assigned)
- Manage:
    - [ ] Create dedicated view for each trade as an intermediate page between the list of all trades and the edit page
    - [ ] Create feature for deleting trades
- Scan:
    - [ ] Consider removing stock metadata scan - **agamotto** is for *option* selection, not for stock selection
    - [ ] Enable creation of presets
- Analyse:
    - [ ] Convert stock metadata table to one with more qualitative information e.g. sector, industry, and company description
    - [ ] Add dedicated stock page and more info on the stock
