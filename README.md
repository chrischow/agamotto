**agamotto** is a simple Flask app to help you stay on top of your Wheel options trading strategy. Like the MCU's [Eye of Agamotto](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Agamotto), it allows you, the bold trader, to harness the power of ~~theta~~ time.

> **Note:** Code for the alpha version of **agamotto** will be released in due time.
